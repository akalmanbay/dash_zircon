0,B09S6FWS7W,"
I have a newer style faucet in my house and the neck of this item did not even fit around the base of the faucet. I tried keeping it hooked around the water conditioner base but it would not hold. The neck of the item is very flimsy. The sponges that come with these I did not use at all as they are inferior to the ones I purchase at the dollar store.

Watch the girth of your faucet! Mine faucet is wide, the hook couldn’t fit around it. I had to return it.
"
2,B09S6FWS7W,"
My faucet is a large spout with built in pullout sprayer. The base is too big. Am finding other ways to use these.
"
3,B09S6FWS7W,"
They should state that it only fits very narrow faucets.
"
4,B09S6FWS7W,"
The product idea is genius, but our faucet is larger in diameter than the product allows so it isn't a good fit in our sink.
"
5,B09S6FWS7W,"
Missing a strainer. Bag looks like it has been reused.
"
6,B09S6FWS7W,"
Not made for a gooseneck faucet or one that is wide at the bottom
"
7,B09S6FWS7W,"
The curve handle did not fit my faucet. I had to strap it with a tie
"
8,B09S6FWS7W,"
I ordered these for myself and two daughters. They don’t fit any of our faucets. They will only work for a very slim faucet base.
"
9,B09S6FWS7W,"
Did not hang like pictured.  Wouldn't fit around my faucet.
"
10,B09S6FWS7W,"
Does not fit the faucet
"
11,B09S6FWS7W,"
The neck handle does not fit around all kitchen sink faucets bummer
"
12,B09S6FWS7W,"
I like the idea of this product but it doesn’t fit on my kitchen sink faucet.
"
13,B09S6FWS7W,"
Sadly the curve is too small for today's sinks and faucets.  I'm still trying to give them away.  I should have known by looking at them so since it was my fault I am not returning them.
"
14,B09S6FWS7W,"
Our faucet is too large for the hook to fit
"
15,B09S6FWS7W,"
Good concept, would work if it fit on the sink although it did not. It’s only fitting for very specific sink style. Also, kind of bigger than expected.
"
16,B09S6FWS7W,"
Doesn't properly fit my sink, too short from hook to strainer. I will use it, but ha e to do so differently
"
17,B09S6FWS7W,"
They do not fit around any of the faucets in my house.
"
18,B09S6FWS7W,"
This product did not work.  The hook to attach around your faucet is too short.  And to return it costs more than the original purchase.  DON'T waste your money on this product!!
"
19,B09S6FWS7W,"
If you have a new faucet it doesn't fit around the bottom.
"
20,B09S6FWS7W,"
This would be great if you have an older style faucet with a skinny base but will not fit most faucet styles of today!
"
21,B09S6FWS7W,"
Do not buy. I’ve tried in a few different sinks and it does not work, does not fit. Just hangs all lopsided. Waste of money.
"
22,B09S6FWS7W,"
Hook is smaller than in looks, doesn't fit around our faucet. It works but we have to hang it off the soap dispenser instead
"
23,B09S6FWS7W,"
I didn't even consider that this might not fit on my sink... But it doesn't. That makes it pretty worthless to me.Even if it did fit around the faucet, it didn't have enough clearance to sit in the sink.Maybe this made for bathroom sinks?
"
24,B09S6FWS7W,"
Great idea; however, it doesn’t fit any of my sinks. The curved neck that goes around the faucet is too small and it is not long enough to sit properly.  I have a Koehler in the kitchen and a generic in the laundry room.  Wish it would be redesigned as it would be handy when cleaning vegetables.
"
25,B09S6FWS7W,"
One of the baskets was damaged. We kept them anyway. I like the job that it does and how it fits on the sink. I have an under mount sink so it’s hooks on my soap dispenser. I just wish it was better quality plastic. I don’t think it will last long. Maybe that’s why you get a multi pack.
"
26,B09S6FWS7W,"
I was so excited for this and was disappointed to see that it only works on the newer, tall, kitchen faucets.  I have an older model and it will not fit!  I’ll keep it until I get a different faucet!
"
27,B09S6FWS7W,"
Love the cuteness, design, and function, but not so universal. Doesn’t fit on our rental house sink, nor the house we just bought, and gave two away and didn’t fit in there sinks. Still using as strainer.
"
28,B09S6FWS7W,"
Doesn’t really fit my sink or my mom’s properly.  But it’s ok.  Just wish the neck was longer so it worked better.
"
29,B09S6FWS7W,"
Product is a great idea, but isn’t one size fits all.  I have a moen faucet and the base is too large for the hook. Other than that great product.
"
30,B09S6FWS7W,"
I like the idea of this, but would be great if they would make the ""head"" adjustable.It doesn't fit on my faucet...
"
31,B09S6FWS7W,"
Unfortunately,  this won't hang on my sink as the photos show.  I can balance it on the space between the double sink, but it falls off as soon as it's bumped.
"
32,B09S6FWS7W,"
It states it will work for all sinks but does not.  I bought the set of 4 to give to family members and they all have under mounted sinks. Returning today.  But otherwise a great product and concept
"
33,B09S6FWS7W,"
The size of the faucet that can be used with this product should have been indicated in the description: it can’t be used with faucets with a larger circumference. Also, the larger holes are too large to catch smaller particles.
"
34,B09S6FWS7W,"
Can't use it on my sink and I waited too long to return.  Added to my Goodwill box.
"
35,B09S6FWS7W,"
It's state it should or do fix most sinks. Does not fit at all.
"
36,B09S6FWS7W,"
The top part that goes around the faucet area needs to be adjustable in some way for the money that you pay I'm not able to us  at all
"
37,B09S6FWS7W,"
Doesn't fit around the base of my faucet. So it sits in my sink which creates clutter. It probably fit a standard fixture
"
38,B09S6FWS7W,"
Did not fit our basic sink.
"
39,B09S6FWS7W,"
Both my sinks it is not long enough hook to sit down in sink. But I do like having it to strain food! Just wish it was longer to sit down in the sink.
"
40,B09S6FWS7W,"
The idea is awesome but it dose t fit my sink.
"
41,B09S6FWS7W,"
It doesn’t fit all faucets
"
42,B09S6FWS7W,"
This is a cute idea but doesn’t seem to work on any of the faucets in my home or my sisters. It is not big enough to wrap around the base of any of our faucets. The colors are also not very desirable in my opinion. Cute idea but hard pass
"
43,B09S6FWS7W,"
Really bummed… says fits all faucets. Not true. It doesn’t fit to my faucet.
"
44,B09S6FWS7W,"
Didn’t fit my faucet
"
45,B09S6FWS7W,"
The item looked like it would fit any faucet, not so.  Since there is no mention of what type faucets it would fit I took a chance. The neck on the corner is much small than it looks.
"
46,B09S6FWS7W,"
Love the idea but it didn’t fit my sink.
"
47,B09S6FWS7W,"
Doesn't fit our sink. So kind of a bummer.
"
48,B09S6FWS7W,"
Will not fit on my sink.  Unusable.  One star because site insisted I give a star rating. I would have submitted with zero  if possible.
"
49,B09S6FWS7W,"
This is my fault, I didn't realize it was used.  Both are broken/cracked.  Not asking for a return or refund, but warning BEWARE of used-good condition.
"
50,B09S6FWS7W,"
The “neck” is too short.  Tried in two different sinks and it it does not fit in either one.  Don’t waste your money or your time.  It’s going to the recycle bin or the thrift store.
"
51,B09S6FWS7W,"
It does not fit my standard kitchen sink. The hook is too short and small.
"
52,B09S6FWS7W,"
Did not fit my sink. Would be a cool product if it was indeed a universal fit as advertised. Going to return
"
53,B09S6FWS7W,"
Not useful
"
54,B09S6FWS7W,"
If you have any new style faucets, do not buy.  The area to fit around the stem of your faucet is geared for old fashioned small faucet bases.  Since this is solid plastic, there are no adjustments to be made.
"
55,B09S6FWS7W,"
Product looked great but doesn’t fit any of my facets! Not useful to me at all!
"
56,B09S6FWS7W,"
Does not fit my sink faucet at home or in the camper!
"
57,B09S6FWS7W,"
No return apparently. Can’t use it
"
58,B09S6FWS7W,"
Does not fit on my faucet!  The ad makes it look SO easy to just pop it on!
"
59,B09S6FWS7W,"
Wouldn't fit my kitchen sink
"
60,B09S6FWS7W,"
The hook part is too narrow.
"
61,B09S6FWS7W,"
I received the item but I tried to hang it on the kitchen sink faucet and the item is too small so I cannot hang it pretty disappointed :(
"
62,B09S6FWS7W,"
Waste of money
"
63,B09S6FWS7W,"
lame, not worth the moneyholes are too bigneck doesn't fit on my faucet
"
64,B09S6FWS7W,"
Both pieces were damaged.  One had been gouged by something and the other piece is cracked.  The neck curve does not fit my faucet/ sink. Disappointed.  Expected better.
"
65,B09S6FWS7W,"
Hook did not fit my faucett
"
66,B09S6FWS7W,"
It did not fit around my faucet as stated.
"
67,B09S6FWS7W,"
Didn't fit around my kitchen sink
"
68,B09S6FWS7W,"
I couldn’t use it because the hook was too small and didn’t fit my facet. Total waste of money because I missed the return window.
"
69,B09S6FWS7W,"
broken on arrival, didn't fit sinks in my home, nor in the home of three others
"
70,B09S6FWS7W,"
Gross, cheap product that does not fit modern spigots
"
71,B09S6FWS7W,"
Product is supposed to fit all faucets, and it doesn't.  I just purcahsed and had to return because it was not compatible with my faucet
"
72,B09S6FWS7W,"
This didn't fit around my kitchen faucet, so I thought about giving it to a friend or family member, but it didn't fit on any of those I tried.
"
73,B09S6FWS7W,"
Hook was not large enough to go around faucet!
"
74,B09S6FWS7W,
75,B09S6FWS7W,"
It does not fit all sinks and faucets.
"
76,B09S6FWS7W,"
They would be a great product but they do not work on any sink I own the offset is not large enough
"
77,B09S6FWS7W,"
The newer faucets are way too big at the base for the drain to hang on.
"
78,B09S6FWS7W,"
Doesn't fit any si k. Waste of money
"
79,B09S6FWS7W,"
Unable to use with a sink unless the base is round and a certain size.  Doesn't set like it shows on pictures.  Be advised.
"
80,B09S6FWS7W,"
Received my strainers and attempted to put one on my kitchen faucet but the hook was too small to wrap around the faucet base.  So in order to use it as intended, I will have to cut the gooseneck in order for it to fit around the base of the faucet or just sit it in the sink like every other strainer that I have.
"
81,B09S6FWS7W,"
This is a great product but didn’t fit my faucet so I can’t use as designed. I can still us it but it has to sit down in the sink.
"
82,B09S6FWS7W,"
Doesn’t fit around my faucet. I have a normal sink, nothing to big or fancy and this doesn’t fit.
"
83,B09S6FWS7W,"
The video I saw made this look like it would fit most universal sinks but guess what.... they don't.  It doesn't fit around the pipe of the spout nor will it stay put to use it appropriately.  Great idea in theory but needs work.  I could probably just lay it in the bottom of the sink but that isn't why I wanted this, so I'm returning the 4 pack or selling them at a garage sale.
"
84,B09S6FWS7W,"
I only need two, so I just threw the other two away, but I expected the plastic to be sturdier. I do not recommend these based on the poor quality. The design is great though, so if they used higher quality plastic that would be better.
"
85,B09S6FWS7W,"
I was excited to get these -- they looked like they would work. However, after using them, I have found that my faucet is too wide. It works okay, but not the best.
"
86,B09S6FWS7W,"
I purchased these because I thought I could use them, however the faucet at my sink is in a location that I cannot use it.I will check with my kids and grandkids to see if they work for them, if not I will have to return them.
"
87,B09S6FWS7W,"
Take a good look at your faucet before purchasing. They won’t work on mine. I’m prob going to go buy a suction hook to put near the sink on the counter. Hopefully that will work.
"
88,B09S6FWS7W,"
We have a standard size faucet at the kitchen sink. However, the hook on this strainer doesn’t fit around it like it shows in the ad. Disappointing.
"
89,B09S6FWS7W,"
I really like this product. The only thing that I don't like is that the curved hook is way to large . It falls off the standard size kitchen  sink faucet . It doesn't curve around enough . I think it is made for the new model faucets that are thicker at the bottom . It is not made with any suction so it's constantly falling off but it does its job
"
90,B09S6FWS7W,"
Don’t fit on my faucet very well. Won’t do what designed for or what I wanted ONE for. Why they only come in multiple packages is beyond me.
"
91,B09S6FWS7W,"
Too ugly for sink. The concept was good but the product is useless
"
92,B09S6FWS7W,"
I have an over size faucet and the neck is too small to hang in corner of sink.
"
93,B09S6FWS7W,"
It didn't fit my faucet. Make sure you check the size
"
94,B09S6FWS7W,"
Small attatchment hook. Be sure to measure your faucet!
"
95,B09S6FWS7W,"
Great idea, ordered 4pack, arrived today and does not fit around base of my Kitchen  faucet,ugh
"
96,B09S6FWS7W,"
Didn’t fit my fsucet
"
97,B09S6FWS7W,"
Great idea but unfortunately this didn’t fit around my faucet. Nowhere to hang it off of. Works fine sitting in sink but defeats the purpose.  Disappointed it says fits all.
"
98,B09S6FWS7W,"
This product doesn’t fit all sinks
"
99,B09S6FWS7W,"
Not big enough for the faucet
"
100,B09S6FWS7W,"
Deceiving pictures doesn’t show it on a real sink faucet! Too big and not long enough. Very disappointed ☹️
"
101,B09S6FWS7W,"
Easy to clean and sturdy. Suction does not spply
"
102,B09S6FWS7W,"
these ""swan"" baskets do not fit my faucet. I returned them and they WILL NOT REFUND MY MONEY. They gave me a dredit with their company. I am a premiun account holder. They said to keep the product instead of returning, what a gimmick!
"
103,B09S6FWS7W,"
As described in the product information - that the product fits all faucets - NOT true!!  The product did not fit around my faucet base - totally disappointed but will keep since I had decided to purchase for some family/friends too - hoping the product will fit around their faucet bases???  Was totally looking forward to this product doing exactly what the definition said because it would have been a most useful product since often cooking requires this (potentially) convenient drainage.  Oh, well, things are not always what they appear and or say!
"
104,B09S6FWS7W,"
They do not fit on my kitchen faucet. Nor do they fit on the faucets of the people I shared them with
"
105,B09S6FWS7W,"
it did not reach around the base of my faucet  But as a strainer it works great
"
106,B09S6FWS7W,"
They are well made. But they did not fit around the base of my kitchen faucet.
"
107,B09S6FWS7W,"
Doesn’t fit all sinks
"
108,B09S6FWS7W,"
I thought these would have bendable heads to conform to different sinks. They are hard plastic and would fit few sinks. Had to return. P
"
109,B09S6FWS7W,"
It was too small to hang on my faucet. It popped up in the air and wouldn't sit flatUseless.
"
110,B09S6FWS7W,"
I tried it on 2 different sinks. Does not work as pictured. Sink base too wide.
"
111,B09S6FWS7W,"
They did not fit my faucets.
"
112,B09S6FWS7W,"
I love the idea, bit it does not fit around my sink faucet.  I sit it in the sink, but it is basically useless.
"
113,B09S6FWS7W,"
The neck on this item is not long enough to fit most sinks.  Poor product, not flexible enough, plastic too hard
"
114,B09S6FWS7W,"
Didn’t fit my kitchen faucet so had to return! Soooo disappointed
"
115,B09S6FWS7W,"
Neck too small to fit around average sink faucet
"
116,B09S6FWS7W,"
Did not fit around faucet and did not strain well.
"
117,B09S6FWS7W,"
Disliked that it didn’t fit faucet, broken, and defective
"
118,B09S6FWS7W,"
These do not fit the corner of my sink nor around the facet. Sadly, I missed the rerun window. I love the idea though. I wish the neck was a little more flexible to go around my facet’s base.
"
119,B09S6FWS7W,"
Returned.  They didn't fit my sink hardware.
"
120,B09S6FWS7W,"
I tried the swan on three different kitchen sinks and it didn’t fit any of them.
"
121,B09S6FWS7W,"
I love the idea but… it doesn’t stay in place for me at all and the 4 pack I have no use for even two…
"
122,B09S6FWS7W,"
sent back  does not fit and not as pictured....all hooks in same direction not two left and two facing right
"
123,B09S6FWS7W,"
Will not fit on a large base faucet
"
124,B09S6FWS7W,"
Doesn't wrap around kitchen faucet.
"
125,B09S6FWS7W,"
Does not fit all faucets…….
"
126,B09S6FWS7W,"
I THOUGHT I WOULD LIKE THIS PRODUCT BUT IT WILL NOT FIT MY SINK!!! SO AS IT TURNES OUT I HAVE NO USE FOR THEM...
"
127,B09S6FWS7W,"
Does not fit on any sink I have tried it on
"
128,B09S6FWS7W,"
Doesn't fit wider faucets
"
129,B09S6FWS7W,"
They fit no sink. The curves to go around the faucet all went same direction this fit no sink. Very disappointed
"
130,B09S6FWS7W,"
The neck is not long enough to attach to my faucet and hang over the sink.  Sending it back. One does not fit all.
"
131,B09S6FWS7W,"
Did not work for my faucet setup. Looks great in the advertising video but not practical for all sink types.
"
132,B09S6FWS7W,"
It does the job though it doesn't line up with the faucet to hang right. It does sit in the corner but if too much weight gets in it, it will tip and spill. A little disappointed that it didn't sit right with my sink.
"
133,B09S6FWS7W,"
This product does not work for all sink types. It’s a great concept and would be perfect for the right kind of sink. I sadly didn’t have a sink it would work with.
"
134,B09S6FWS7W,"
I purchased two pack of this item to divide between myself and my daughter-in-law’s. These do not fit in my sink. They also did not fit in one of my daughter-in-law’s sink. I haven’t given the other girls them yet but I’m guessing they won’t work in theirs either. Safe your money.
"
135,B09S6FWS7W,"
Does what I need but doesn’t work for my sink so I had to modify.
"
136,B09S6FWS7W,"
This didn’t fix around the faucet like it says it will!
"
137,B09S6FWS7W,"
very cheaply made and was cracked when i received it.  Did not fit around my faucet either.
"
138,B09S6FWS7W,"
Did not fit my sink and I have returned them
"
139,B09S6FWS7W,"
These work great if you have a standard sink/faucet
"
140,B09S6FWS7W,"
Cool concept but needs work. It didn’t fit my sink the way I thought it would.Be aware: you need a very specific size and type of sink and faucet for it to work. It’s really not very universal. It’s small, and not a great value for the price in my opinion. This would be a cool item if it was a better design.
"
141,B09S6FWS7W,"
Cheaply made
"
142,B09S6FWS7W,"
Doesn't fit around the Moen faucet.
"
143,B09S6FWS7W,"
as above does not fit my kitchen facet,  they did return my money
"
144,B09S6FWS7W,"
The product was as it was described but it doesn't fit thick faucets. If you have a kitchen faucet that has a pull out sprayer, this product will not fit.
"
145,B09S6FWS7W,"
Doesn’t fit sink nozzle
"
146,B09S6FWS7W,"
This does not fit my faucet. Not even close.  A total waste of my money.  I believe it was shipped from overseas, so it is next to impossible to return and get a refund.  Looks like it will be donated to a thrift store.
"
147,B09S6FWS7W,"
It was simply a piece of garbage - would not fit either my sink or most sinks I know of. The little hook would fit around only the oldest faucets. And it comes from an address of Joe Doe in Delaware - web page based in China. I checked BBB - seeing the Joe Doe in the return address raised red flags in my mind. Amazon did refund my money right away.
"
148,B09S6FWS7W,"
When I saw these I knew I wanted them, so I ordered. It took a while to get them. When they did arrive, of course, I tried them on my kitchen sink right away. Whomp, whomp ... a good idea, but doesn't fit all faucets. I don't even know how to suggest what faucet it would work on. It didn't fit in the corner of my sink, it was more on top
"
149,B09S6FWS7W,"
The basket itself is pretty sturdy, but the neck that is supposed to hang on your faucet is really flimsy and can't handle much weight at all.
"
150,B09S6FWS7W,"
They do not fit on typical single faucets. The hook part is not nearly big enough to fit around the faucet to hang over the sink. The neck is not long enough either even if the hook would accommodate the faucet. These looked useful but sadly are not.
"
151,B09S6FWS7W,"
Doesn't fit universally. Wish the hook was made for a range of a few sizes bigger/wider. The hook is too shallow. Wish they came up with an adjustable type hook or closure. I have to manually set up down on my sink and it gets buried under dishes easily, making it inaccessible when I need it most. It won't even stay put on the corner lip of the sink.
"
152,B09S6FWS7W,"
Does not fit around all faucets
"
153,B09S6FWS7W,"
Too awkward. I purchased thinking it would stop the food going into sink strainer.  Food went right though holes in product defeating the reason I purchased it.  Products was a lot larger than I expected.
"
154,B09S6FWS7W,"
Very well made it just doesn’t fit on my faucet which makes it useless to me. Nice product I just wish it fit all faucets
"
155,B09S6FWS7W,"
Doesn't fit around faucet, very disappointed. I tossed it
"
156,B09S6FWS7W,"
Darn what a good idea, but the swan neck was too small to fit around our faucet base. I still use it in the sink, but do measure if you want to hang this as shown.
"
157,B09S6FWS7W,"
Did not fit my kitchen faucet too small returning.
"
158,B09S6FWS7W,"
Can't use. It doesn't fit my sink facet at all. Sorry!!!!
"
159,B09S6FWS7W,"
It was constructed well, small inside basket the perimeter was too thickly made although it was sturdy.
"
160,B09S6FWS7W,"
Have a basic sink, common faucet size, but wouldn't fit around it. Pretty disappointing...
"
161,B09S6FWS7W,"
Wouldn't work for my sink Sent back
"
162,B09S6FWS7W,"
Awesome concept but it didn't fit my sink/faucet.
"
163,B09S6FWS7W,"
Super versatile for straining leftovers off dishes or rinsing out sink drains but the neck needs to be a bit longer and wider.
"
164,B09S6FWS7W,"
Doesn’t fit many sink faucets.
"
165,B09S6FWS7W,"
I wish the hook was a little bigger.  It didn't fit around the base of my faucet.
"
166,B09S6FWS7W,"
Nice idea but my faucet has a wide base and the handle on the product does not fit.
"
167,B09S6FWS7W,"
The fit was not as good as I thought it would be don't waste your money

Didn’t fit around my standard faucet.
"

I returned these because they didn’t fit well and  too small to hold very much in them.
"
170,B09S6FWS7W,"
I am keeping them because I can find a way to make them work. Maybe. But while they fit around the neck of my faucet they do not sit on the corner of the sink as shown in the description. I have two standard size sinks and it doesn’t fit either one.

After watching the videos I decided that I needed these Swan Sink Drainers. Someone had a great idea but it's just too bad that they didn't fit my sink or any of my friends sinks that I tried to give them too. They appear to be made for a very small sink. I donated them to a thrift store.

Read the description carefully.  (I didn't and could not use it because the diameter was too small for our faucet.  It would be great if it fit.
"
173,B09S6FWS7W,"
I guess it is very useful if it fit my faucet, but it does not at all.  Still usable though
"
174,B09S6FWS7W,"
Dislike how large this is
"
175,B09S6FWS7W,"
Very difficult to put around faucet. Hard to remove without fear of breaking
"
176,B09S6FWS7W,"
Would love to use but too short for my faucet.
"
177,B09S6FWS7W,"
Its a great idea but doesnt fit on my sink. Might want to add in what sinks it does fit on.
"
178,B09S6FWS7W,"
Neck too small for our faucet. But it works , and I like it.
"
179,B09S6FWS7W,"
They don't fit my sink. Can't use
"
180,B09S6FWS7W,"
I was excited to get these after seeing how they work.  But the way my faucet is put on and the space between the 2 sinks.  It won't hook on and sit flat.
"
181,B09S6FWS7W,"
the basket is a great idea, but it can only fit around smaller faucets... way too small for the body of my regular sized faucet
"
182,B09S6FWS7W,"
The yellow one was fine. The blue one was so dirty I threw it away.
"
183,B09S6FWS7W,"
I have a standard size sink and this is just too big. The holder doesn’t fit around my faucet and the basket takes up too much room. It is a great tool though and super easy to clean.
"
184,B09S6FWS7W,"
My facet has the two spigots on each side and blocked the neck of the strainer from hanging on the spigot.
"
185,B09S6FWS7W,"
Looks like it would be awesome, but doesn't fit my style kitchen sink.  Grateful for easy return.
"
186,B09S6FWS7W,"
Does not fit my faucet. you need to give the measurements and state so.
"
187,B09S6FWS7W,"
It doesn’t fit a square faucet base. It never occurred to me to check if it would work on a square faucet base. it sadly does not.
"
188,B09S6FWS7W,"
Won’t fit around faucet base probably won’t fit most new faucets
"
189,B09S6FWS7W,"
Didn't fit my sink faucet
"
190,B09S6FWS7W,"
I was pumped to get these but slightly disappointed when I did. I have the most common & average sink/faucet set up & these do not hook around the faucet as advertised. I placed one in the outer corner & set a heavy soap pump on it & it stays put while holding multiple different brushes/scrubbies so it worked out ok. Just not as intended.
"
191,B09S6FWS7W,"
The blue is not a turquoise it's a baby blue. They're not really very sturdy, seem very flimsy
"
192,B09S6FWS7W,"
Hangs loosely and food drops out of it.
"
193,B09S6FWS7W,"
Product did not work as described.
"
194,B09S6FWS7W,"
It's a great idea. But n ck is to small for most faucets.I'm sad.I really wanted to use it.
"
195,B09S6FWS7W,"
The swan neck too small & the basket so big that it would not fit down in my sink.  I returned them.
"
196,B09S6FWS7W,"
The loops are too stiff and did not fit around my faucet.  Waste of money and time.  Returned.
"
197,B09S6FWS7W,"
It does not fit all sinks or faucets neck, it’s useless but couldn’t not return it back
"
198,B09S6FWS7W,"
Holes aren’t punched all the way thru. Doesn’t work the best with sinks with space between the faucet and the sink.
"
199,B09S6FWS7W,"
Don't count on this fitting your faucet! Handle is short...won't fit my sink .
"
200,B09S6FWS7W,"
Little hook is too short and narrow to fit standard American sinks. Took forever to get.
"
201,B09S6FWS7W,"
not long enough to work in sink
"
202,B09S6FWS7W,"
Will not hook around any faucet in my house. Way to small. I will still use, just wish it would work as stated.
"
203,B09S6FWS7W,"
Product make was sturdy and good, but the hook won’t fit a lot of modern sinks
"
204,B09S6FWS7W,"
I can't even use them they came smashed together you can't get them apart
"
205,B09S6FWS7W,"
Does not fit at all. Don’t waste your money
"
206,B09S6FWS7W,"
These do not fit my faucet.
"
207,B09S6FWS7W,"
The handle is to small it doesn't fit the faucet I had to hang in on the soap dispenser.
"
208,B09S6FWS7W,"
It doesn’t fit on sink at all
"
209,B09S6FWS7W,"
